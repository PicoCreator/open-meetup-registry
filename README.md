# Open Meetup Registry

> Note this is a working title - this WILL get renamed accordingly to the final name

This spec defines how data would be exchanged between a 

+ "participant platform"
+ "organizer platform"

While the spec may define what it expect for either platform. Implementations of either platform only need to ensure compliance with the data exchange. And are actually encouraged to customize according to their unique use case.
